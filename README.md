# Nervos-X-to-earn

I have been a victim of internet privacy infringement, denial of true data, Data enslavement, False news, censorship and thing you can think of.
I this point in time, we need a platform where we can share any true information, where can access real data, and where we can share real work of Art.
We should also be able to earn something for doing that and punish defaulters. All on a decentralized network - NERVOS. 

We created CEARN with the vision to create a platform better like twitter where anyone can share anything once it is legal, and not abuse right to fair data.
We are building and hosting on a decentralized storage system and also open sourcing our code for everyone.

DAPP TECHNICAL DETAILS
> The first thing i will point out is that the DAPP is hosted on IPFS. https://ipfs.fleek.co/ipfs/QmTS6Lgk7ysSFDBBBNsNMn1sbMiUtXxfy4Fgfxa7LGSciZ/index.html
> We did not have enough time but the database and the backend of the DAPP will use the libp2p to store data and broadcast data just like the orbitdb
> We are still working on getting the best Solution for the Audio Cspace.
> Where possible with transaction gas in mind... data might be stored on the Nervos Network(a option we are considering)
> The DAPP you are seeing now is a DEMO and will not function properly.

But How do we ensure that real data are shared and not just anything just for you to earn.
We devised a mechanism as follow;
- immediately you submit a post, article or you host a space, you will be given a certain token amount but the token will remain locked for a week or until you get at least two likes ...
- Dont be too excited that you can easily use another wallet to like your article/writeup
- To protect against spam, we will make liking writeups expensive and disliking cheaper. We will also make sure that for every dislike a like is removed. This in a way we reduce cheating the system.
- We will also add a tipping system for anyone that prefers to tip the writer rather than wasting his or her tokens on likes.
- We will get funds to run the DAPP from clear ads and from transaction fees.
- We will also have a DATA section that will display realtime prices of token and a dex to swap.
- Users will also be encouraged to stake their CKB tokens for DAO voting.

We have a demonstration for the project and we have a long term plan.

We will be the First of its Kind of Nervous Network.
